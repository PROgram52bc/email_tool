Hi Dr. DeLong,
I really appreciated your prayer and support during the mission trip that I attended in April! It happened that I will be participating in another mission trip to South America in January 2019, which is arranged mainly for Computer Science students, who will then be serving the people there with technical supports.
Your prayer will certainly bring me encouragements and strengths in every subtle way-- if you would like to continue praying for me (or to support me financially), please reply to this email, so that I can forward you any progress of the trip. Thanks!
David Deng
